# rocm-build 5.2.1

### Thanks

Thanks [xuhuisheng](https://github.com/xuhuisheng/rocm-build) for the base scripts

### Start

My environment is Nobara 36.

Please download the base [yum/centos7 ROCm](https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Installation-Guide.html#centos-rhel) repo as currently this github repo only has the packages that need to be patched.

Execute `bash setup.sh` to setup environment variables.

Execute `source env.sh` to setup environment variables.

Execute `bash install-dependency.sh` to install dependencies

Then execute bash scripts by order number.

Good luck.
